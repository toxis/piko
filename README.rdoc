How setting up and start this application:

* Have at least one piko inverter from Kostal (http://www.kostal-solar-electric.com/)

* You can access it through your network by a fixed IP address and you know username and password to read data

* Create and configure database.yml and secrets.yml (in config folder)

* Create database and run migrations

* Add inverters and zones in database (with rails console for example, currently no UI to do this)

* Configure cron jobs with whenever gem (be sure bin/rails has execution rights) and restart cron service
